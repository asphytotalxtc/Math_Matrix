Dear Jesus

Using your Math_Matrix implemention (v 1.6 2003/04/14 11:27:52) i got the
impression that there is something wrong with your multiply()-method.

The first problem was, that the matrices were not able to have negativ row
or col-values (the negative ones turn to zero). So, on line 1117, i made
the following instead of your line:

//if ($data[$i][$j] <= $epsilon) {
if ( abs($data[$i][$j]) <= $epsilon) {

The Second problem was, that i couldn't multiply a [1x5] with a [5x5]
matrix. So i also changed the condition of your second check and it worked
out (line 1106):

//if ($nc1 != $nr) {
if ($nc != $nr1) {

Do you agree with my feedback or am i wrong? :-)
Thanks
